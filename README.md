# Juju verify

This CLI tool is a Juju plugin that allows user to check whether it's safe
to perform some disruptive maintenance operations on Juju units, like `shutdown`
or `reboot`.

## Supported charms

* nova-compute (WIP)
* ceph-osd (WIP)

## Supported checks

* reboot
* shutdown

**NOTE:** Final list of supported checks and what they represent is still WIP

## Usage example

To verify that it's OK to stop/shutdown units `nova-compute/0` and 
`nova-compute/1` without affecting rest of the Openstack cloud run following.

```bash
$ juju-verify shutdown nova-compute/0 nova-compute/1
```

**NOTE:** If you run check on multiple units at the same time, they must all run
the same charm. Trying, for example, `juju-verify shutdown nova-compute/1
ceph-osd/0` will result in error.

## How to contirbute

Is your favorite charm missing from the list of supported charm? Don't hesitate
to add it. This plugin is easily extensible. All you need to do is create new
class in `juju_verify.verifiers` package that inherits from
`juju_verify.verifiers.BaseVerifier` (see the class documentation for more
details) and implements the necessary logic. Then it needs to be added to
`SUPPORTED_CHARMS` dictionary in `juju_verify/verifiers/__init__.py` *et voil√†*,
the charm is now supported.

## TODO

* Check if machine runs other principal unties aside from those that are being
checked
* Allow targeting Juju machines, not just units for checks. e.g. `juju-verify
shutdown --machine 0`
* Add unit tests before moving on with further implementation
